# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and followed a tutorial called [React JS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8). The original code can also be found in this this [repo](https://github.com/bradtraversy/react-crash-2021).

**Note(3/20/23)**: Some variations to the code shown in the referenced repo above were made because particularly beacuse React-Router has since updated some of their `Route` properties.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` / `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run server`

Runs the json server which is used as a quick start-up solution for holding task data, rather than a full-blown server and database setup. The json server will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
